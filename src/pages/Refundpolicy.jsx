          <b> TNENNT TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED</b> believes in helping its
            customers as far as possible, and has therefore a liberal
            cancellation policy. Under this policy: <br /><br />• Cancellations will be
            considered only if the request is made immediately after placing the
            order. However, the cancellation request may not be entertained if
            the orders have been communicated to the vendors/merchants and they
            have initiated the process of shipping them.<br /> <br />• <b> TNENNT TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED</b> does not accept cancellation requests for perishable
            items like flowers, eatables etc. However, refund/replacement can be
            made if the customer establishes that the quality of product
            delivered is not good. <br /> <br />• In case of receipt of damaged or defective
            items please report the same to our Customer Service team. The
            request will, however, be entertained once the merchant has checked
            and determined the same at his own end. This should be reported
            within Only same day days of receipt of the products. In case you
            feel that the product received is not as shown on the site or as per
            your expectations, you must bring it to the notice of our customer
            service within Only same day days of receiving the product. The
            Customer Service Team after looking into your complaint will take an
            appropriate decision. <br /> <br />• In case of complaints regarding products
            that come with a warranty from manufacturers, please refer the issue
            to them. In case of any Refunds approved by the <b> TNENNT TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED</b>, it’ll take 6-8 Days days for the refund to be
            processed to the end customer.
